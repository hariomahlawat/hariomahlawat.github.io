Hello! Iâ€™m Hari Om Ahlawat. To talk about myself, I love tennis (Let's put things straight: Roger Federer is GOAT), playing chess, liatening music and reading books. I have a great interest in Machine Learning & Data Science, and am pursuing my career in the same.

I have done MTech in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IITD).

My inquisitive nature, craving for knowledge, and longing for novelty and innovation strengthen my passion to work and learn daily to increase my knowledge horizon.

I am mostly into tech and so, my blog will be a reflection of whatever new thing I learn about tech.

Thank you for visiting my blog.
